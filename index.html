    <h2>Engineering Journal:</h2>
    <p>9/2/22: I started to think about what I was going to do for a rube goldberg machine.
    I made a microwave using tinkercad. This improved my tinkercad skills with placement and efficiency.</p>
    <img src = "microwave.png" width = "200px" hieght = "100">
    <p>9/9/22: We started cading for the rube goldberg machine that we are going to have to construct.
    We all had our own ideas but we choose Isaac's idea which involed ramps, levers, and a pully.</p>
    <img src = "rubecad.jpeg" width = "200px" hieght = "100">
    <p>9/16/22: I did a paper boat project where I had to make a boat float with weights in it for 5 minutes.
    I made a rectangle boat with walls using 40g in weight. This manged to float for 5 minutes without many problems.
    I learned that the more surface area you had, the better the boat would float due to buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>9/26/22: We finshed our rube goldberg machine project today. We weren't able to test it, however we managed to complete and finish the design.
    We tested the machanics which seemed to work so I believe that it would be able to pop the balloon.
    We also disensembled a computer in order to learn about the the different parts of the computer and where they were.</p>
    <img src = "comp.jpeg" width = "200px" hieght = "100">
    <p>10/10/22: We finished our cad for our bottle rocket project including the wings.
    We also were finally able to finish our rube goldberg machine which was successful at popping a ballon. 
    Finally I made a paper ball to throw at a bin which was our challenge which was better than a paper plane.
    I did my cad of a bat wing as well which I finished this week.</p>

    <p>10/21/22: We caded our bottle rockets with the goal of traveling the farthest distance,
    we finished it and our rocket did okay compared to the others, but none went very far and most
    either went backwards.</p>

    <p>10/28/22: We made a water filter that filtered dirty water which kinda worked, I think it needed more cotton
    to filter it, we also did a project where we had to fit as many candy corn on a paper as possible, we got two answers,
    374 and 218 since we used to different tactics. </p>
    <p>11/4/22: We learned about electrical engineering and we did tinkercads.
    These were focused on curcuits and how negative and positive power works. 
    We played around with resistors and LEDs as well as confiquerations of curicits like Series and Parallel.
    </p>
    <img src = "curcuit.png" width = "200px" hieght = "100">
    <P>11/9/22: This week we played around with curcuits and how they work.
    We managed to create a series and parrel curcuit which lit up a few red LED lights.
    Finally, we did a challenge where we had to calculate if writting #'s 1-1000000 took less time then taking a math class.
    Taking a math class was much faster than writting 1 million munbers.</P>
    <img src = "threeLED.jpeg" width = "200px" hieght = "100">
    <P>11/18/22: This week we experienmented cuiruits with arduinos and made our own curcuits.
    The goal was to use code to light up LED lights in a specific order.
    On the last day we had a debate between if their were more wheels or doors at the school, wheels for sure won.</P>

    <p>12/2/22: This entire week was spend on our final project.
    Our task was to make a bridge that would hold a bucket using 20 paste strands.
    We worked on a design, however, the first one failed, but we are now working one a different design not pased off of a beam.</p>
     <p>12/9/22: This week again, we spend the whole time building brigdes.
     We managed to make a bridge that held a cup full with water using a lot
     of glue. We are now planning our new brigde based off what didn't work before.
     </p>
     <p>12/20/22: This week is the last one dedicated for the spagetti bridge.
     We didn't get a bridge which would hold all of the water in the bucket.
     However, one of our first bridges was just a beam, it managed to hold half a bucket of water(small bucket)
     We then thought that if we could add more glue to the beam, it would be stronger.
     We got boba straws, put the straw into the boba straws, and then poured glue into them.
     We were hoping that it would dry and it would for a think layer of glue.
     However we put it in the window and it cooked the spegetti so it was flimsly. 
     It also didn't dry so the glue was wet and we had to cut open the boba straws.
     This led to a lot of the glue being lost and due to the spegetti being cooked, it broke.
     This might that we had to repair it with a weaker end, which was broken when Mr. Kim picked it up.
     So our bridges failed, excpet the beam of glue which managed to hold a full bucket of water, the cast of glue did succeed, although it is debatable if that counts as a bridge. The main reason we weren't able to make a better bridge, I believe is that it took to long to make the bridge from the boba.
     We also didn't get much done in the begining since our bridge designs kept failing or getting stuck to the cardboard when we were glueing.
     I feel like one of the things that we could do better was maybe testing bridges and fixing their plaws instead of 
     going for a beam with glue.
     I also think that we could have started with trying a traditional bridge design.
     This might have given us better ideas than what the beam did.

     <p>1/13/23: This week we were tasked with comming up with a business idea.
     Our idea was a self building tent, our hope that it would be light weight and easy to use.
     Our main costumer base would be casual campers and people that don't know what they are doing.
     This was our buisness engineering project and we had to come up with multiple ideas before we chose this one.</p>
     <P>1/20/23: This week we learned about chemical engineering and what they do.
     We also did an experiment where we mixed corn starch with water, in order to make a state where it sometimes acts as a liquid or a solid.
     We were successful at creating this and by far the hardest part was cleaning up which took like 20 minutes.
     </P>
     <p>1/27/23: This week we did a challenge to due with freeway traffic.
     Our goal was to make the best highway system to limit the amount of trafic.
     We managed to get multiple high scores and got the highest score out of any group.</p>
     <p>2/3/23: We made our planning sheet for our project this week.
     We descided to go for the mouse trap car and we made our DOM, boigraphies,
     Timeline, project description, and we cited our sources.</p>
     <p>2/10/22: This week we finished our cad and started thinking about how we would make the mousetrap car.
     We didn't have all the products we needed so the only thing we were able to complete was the axels and the trap and </p>
     <P>2/3/23: We started working on our mouse trap car, where we were able to figure out demensions and the materials we wanted to use.
     We used disks for wheels, wood for axels and the lever, cardboard for the chaise and string.</P>
     <p>2/12/23: We worked on our first prototype and we almost finished it, we got the axels and the chaise done.</p>     
     <p>2/17/23: We finshed our first prototype mouse trap car, we noticed that it wasn't perfect,
     We noticed that one thing that we could fix was the wieght, since the chaise was very big,
     we also wanted to make sure tha the wheels we straight.</p>
     <p>2/24/23: We started our second model for our mouse trap car, we almost finished the whole design. 
     The differences were that we made the chasise smaller which made it wieght less.</p>
    <p>3/3/23: We finished our mousetrap car and tested it this week.
    Our mousetrap car was one of the best in both classes, therefore we achieved our goal.
    This was to make a mousetrap car which travels the most distance possible. We created a protoytpe
    and based off of the results we made an improved final version. 
    The thing that we did to make it better is we made it smaller and it now wieghed less. 
    We did this by using less tape, making the chaise smaller which used less cardboard. 
    If we had more time to work on it, it think that the main issue with it was how the axels where attached and that could have been improved on.
    Another thing that would have helped is if we got better materials like wood instead of cardboard(I know this wasn't possible due to budget).

     <p>3/10/23:This week we did a challenge, the challenge was to make the best boat that
     would go the furthest in a gutter. We designed a boat which would use air to accelate
     thorugh a deflating balloon. This did not work, however we were able to blow it 10 ft.
    </p>
    <p>3/24/23: We were introduced to our new project which was to prevent an egg dropping from 3 stories and breaking.
    We finished our DOM and our CAD, we used ballons on the bottom, a cardboard triauglar pyramind, botton balls and the egg inside the cardboard, string attached to a trashbag to act as a parachute.
    </p>
    <img src = "podegg.jpeg" width = "200px" hieght = "100">
    <p>3/31/23: This week we tested our project to protect an egg from a 3 story drop. Our plan worked perfectly and the project worked and floated down 
    slowly down with a soft landing. The egg was protected from the fall with 0 cracks and our project was successful.</p>
    <p>4/7/23: This week we did our CAD and planning as well as starting to constuct our boat. We are planning on making a raft and using tape to keep water off the cardboard.
    We hope my making it have a large surface area will prevent it from sinking. </p>
     <p>4/14/23: We finsihed cutting the cardboard neccissary for our boat and now our waiting for tape to continue construction. </p>
    <p>4/21/23: This week we worked on making the outline of our boat, we managed to put the general shape of our boat using the limited tape
    that we had access to. We also taked about the design we wanted for our paddles. </p>
    <p>4/28/23: We worked on taping the boat together this week and made sure that it was okay.</p>
    <p>5/5/23: We continued work on taping the boat together again. </p>
    <p>5/12/23: We worked on taping the boat together and also decorated it since we finished our raft design.</p>
